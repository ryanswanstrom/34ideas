<h2>34ideas.com Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

<p>Like most website operators, 34ideas.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 34ideas.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 34ideas.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, 34ideas.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>34ideas.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. 34ideas.com only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>Certain visitors to 34ideas.com’s websites choose to interact with 34ideas.com in ways that require 34ideas.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 34ideas.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at WordPress.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 34ideas.com – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 34ideas.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 34ideas.com. 34ideas.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

<p>34ideas.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, 34ideas.com may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. 34ideas.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, 34ideas.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

<p>34ideas.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 34ideas.com’s behalf or to provide services available at 34ideas.com’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 34ideas.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when 34ideas.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 34ideas.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an 34ideas.com website and have supplied your email address, 34ideas.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with 34ideas.com and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 34ideas.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
