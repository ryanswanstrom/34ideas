Idea(sweetcorn):
  txt: Sell sweetcorn door-to-door. Children or adults could load up a wagon of fresh sweetcorn, walk through neighborhoods, and sell the sweetcorn.  An extra fee could also be charged to shuck the corn. I believe a child could fund his/her entire summer with only a couple weeks of work.
